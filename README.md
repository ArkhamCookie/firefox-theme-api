# FireFox Themes & Theme API Testing

A repo for messing around with [Firefox](https://firefox.com)'s [themes](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/themes/) and [theme API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/theme).

## FireFox Themes

> With themes, you can customize the look of your Firefox by adding images to the header part of the section and changing the colors of the tab strip, address bar, toolbars, and [other supported areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/theme#colors)
>
> These themes use the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions), the technology used to modify or enhance the capability of Firefox. You can choose to create a [static theme](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/themes/static-themes/), which don't change after installation, or a [dynamic theme](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/themes/dynamic-themes/) if you would like to bundle your theme in an extension or programmatically control changes to theme.
